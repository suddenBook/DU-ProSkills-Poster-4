# Innovating for Impact: Designing Solutions to Economic and Social Challenges

## Topic
An application of one or more innovation methods to an economic / social challenge that may be in the current media

## Target Audience
General non-scientific audience such as entrepreneurs, intrapreneurs, and innovation managers

## Project Overview
This poster aims to explore the application of systematic innovation methods, specifically Design Thinking and TRIZ, to address current economic and social challenges. Through an informative and visually engaging poster, we strive to convey the key principles, benefits, and real-world impact of these methods within a concise format suitable for a general audience.

## Highlights of the Poster
- **Introduction to Innovation Methods**: The poster introduces Design Thinking and TRIZ as powerful approaches for generating novel ideas, driving user-centric design, resolving technical contradictions, and tackling complex real-world problems.
- **Design Thinking Deep Dive**: We delve into the five stages of the Design Thinking process (Empathize, Define, Ideate, Prototype, Test), illustrating them with a clear visual representation. The key benefits of Design Thinking, such as fostering empathy and enabling rapid learning, are also highlighted.
- **TRIZ Explained**: The poster presents the core principles of TRIZ, including the use of 40 inventive principles and contradiction matrices to solve technical problems systematically. The strengths of TRIZ, like leveraging proven problem-solving patterns, are emphasized.
- **Real-World Applications**: We showcase how Design Thinking can be applied to address economic challenges such as supply chain disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic. For social challenges, we demonstrate how TRIZ principles can generate innovative solutions to combat climate change, supported by a projected emissions reduction graph.
- **Impact and Conclusion**: The poster underscores the widespread adoption and impact of Design Thinking and TRIZ across various industries. It concludes with a call to action for the audience to master and apply these innovation methods to create positive change.
